type: experiment
title: Moving Average vs Naive Forecast Evaluation
summary: >-
  This experiment evaluates the forecasting performance of a 3-point moving average versus a naive persistence (last-value)
  baseline across 100 synthetic noisy time series. Results show that smoothing via moving average reduces mean squared error
  (MSE) from 1.9847 to 1.3558, demonstrating the benefit of smoothing under Gaussian noise. Time series forecasting is a critical
  component of many predictive modeling tasks across finance, economics, weather forecasting, and industrial monitoring. When
  data is corrupted by observation noise or short-term random fluctuations, naive baseline forecasters that simply project
  the most recent observation forward can suffer from high variance and poor predictive accuracy. In contrast, moving average
  models smooth out high-frequency noise by aggregating past observations over a fixed sliding window. To rigorously test
  this hypothesis, we generated 100 synthetic time series paths, each spanning 30 time steps, incorporating a deterministic
  linear upward trend combined with additive zero-mean Gaussian noise of standard deviation 1.0. For every time step starting
  from index 3, we computed both the 3-point moving average prediction and the naive persistence prediction, recording the
  squared errors for each method across all runs and evaluation points. Our empirical findings confirm that the 3-point moving
  average achieves a substantially lower mean squared error of 1.3558 compared to 1.9847 for the naive persistence baseline,
  yielding a robust error reduction and performance improvement of 0.6290. These results validate the efficacy of moving average
  smoothing in mitigating random noise in short-horizon time series forecasting scenarios.

# Introduction\n\nTime series forecasting underpins decision-making in diverse application domains, including economic forecasting, stock market analysis, energy grid telemetry, and industrial equipment health monitoring [1]. In many practical settings, practitioners encounter short-horizon forecasting tasks where historical observations are scarce and corrupted by high-frequency observational noise [2]. Establishing robust baseline models is essential before deploying complex parametric or deep learning architectures [3]. Among foundational baseline models, the naive persistence forecaster—which assumes that the future value will equal the most recent observation—and the moving average forecaster—which computes the unweighted mean of past observations over a sliding window—serve as primary points of comparison [2].\n\nDespite their conceptual simplicity, the precise error trade-offs between naive persistence and moving average smoothing on short, noisy sequences remain a critical baseline benchmark. Naive forecasting is highly responsive to immediate changes but suffers from extreme variance amplification when observation noise is present. Conversely, smoothing methods like the 3-point moving average suppress high-frequency random fluctuations at the cost of potential lag. Understanding the quantitative margin of improvement under controlled Gaussian noise distributions provides foundational insight for statistical modeling.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a rigorous comparative evaluation of a 3-point moving average forecasting model versus a naive last-value persistence baseline. Using a synthetic dataset generator spanning diverse sequence lengths, trend configurations, and noise levels [ARTIFACT:art_k4m-oBvAqLyv], we evaluate forecasting performance across 100 independent noisy time series paths [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26]. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- We establish a rigorous experimental framework for evaluating short-horizon forecasting baselines under controlled additive Gaussian noise (sigma = 1.0) [ARTIFACT:art_k4m-oBvAqLyv].\n- We demonstrate empirically that a 3-point moving average model reduces Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 1.9847 (naive baseline) to 1.3558, achieving a robust performance improvement of 0.6290 [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26].\n- We perform exhaustive statistical significance testing via paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, establishing that the error reductions achieved by moving average smoothing are highly statistically significant (p < 10^-40) [ARTIFACT:art_PAVwq5tc5rW6].\n\n[FIGURE:fig1]\n\n# Background and Related Work\n\nStatistical time series forecasting has a rich history grounded in classical autoregressive and moving average frameworks [1]. The foundations of linear time series models, popularized by Box et al. [1], emphasize the decomposition of series into trend, seasonal, and irregular components. When observation noise dominates short-horizon sequences, classical smoothing techniques remain indispensable.\n\nIn modern benchmarking literature, such as the M-Competitions [3], simple statistical baselines like naive persistence, simple moving averages, and exponential smoothing serve as foundational yardsticks against which advanced machine learning models are measured. While recent advances in transformer-based and neural time series forecasters have expanded capacity, understanding the fundamental variance-bias trade-offs of basic smoothing versus persistence under noise is vital [2]. Our work directly addresses this by providing exact parametric evaluations on short synthetic series.\n\n# Methodology\n\nTo rigorously evaluate forecasting models under controlled conditions, we formulate a synthetic time series generation and evaluation pipeline [ARTIFACT:art_k4m-oBvAqLyv].\n\n## Synthetic Data Generation\n\nWe generate synthetic time series paths defined by an underlying deterministic trend combined with additive zero-mean Gaussian noise. Formally, a time series y_t for t = 1, ..., T is modeled as:\n\ny_t = f(t) + epsilon_t\n\nwhere f(t) represents the underlying trend configuration (e.g., a linear upward trend f(t) = m * t + c) and epsilon_t ~ N(0, sigma^2) represents observation noise with standard deviation sigma = 1.0. Sequence lengths are set to T in {30, 40, 50}, and evaluation is conducted across 100 independent simulation runs [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26].\n\n## Forecasting Models\n\nWe evaluate two primary baseline forecasting strategies:\n\n1. **Naive Persistence Model**: Predicts that the next time step equals the current observed value:\n\nhat{y}_{t+1}^{naive} = y_t\n\n2. **3-Point Moving Average Model**: Predicts the next value as the unweighted mean of the preceding three observations:\n\nhat{y}_{t+1}^{ma} = (1 / 3) sum_{i=0}^{2} y_{t-i}\n\nEvaluation commences at time step t = 3 to ensure a complete 3-point sliding window history is available [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26].\n\n[FIGURE:fig2]\n\n# Experiments and Results\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\nWe implemented the evaluation pipeline in Python, executing 100 independent simulation runs over synthetic time series paths of length T = 30 with Gaussian noise sigma = 1.0 [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26]. For each time step from t = 3 onward, we recorded the squared errors for both the 3-point moving average and the naive persistence baseline [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26].\n\n## Quantitative Forecasting Performance\n\nTable 1 summarizes the core forecasting error metrics comparing the 3-point moving average against the naive persistence baseline across all evaluation runs [ARTIFACT:art_PAVwq5tc5rW6].\n\n| Forecasting Method | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Naive Persistence Baseline | 1.9847 | 1.4088 | 1.1245 |\n| 3-Point Moving Average | **1.3558** | **1.1644** | **0.9312** |\n| **Error Reduction / Improvement** | **+0.6290** | **+0.2444** | **+0.1933** |\n\nAs reported in Table 1, the 3-point moving average achieves an MSE of **1.3558**, substantially outperforming the naive baseline MSE of **1.9847**, yielding an error reduction of **0.6290** (a 31.7% relative reduction in MSE) [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26]. Similar improvements are observed in RMSE (1.1644 vs 1.4088) and MAE (0.9312 vs 1.1245) [ARTIFACT:art_PAVwq5tc5rW6].\n\n[FIGURE:fig3]\n\n## Statistical Significance and Robustness\n\nTo verify that the observed performance gains are not artifacts of random sampling fluctuations, we conducted paired hypothesis tests. Both the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test yielded p-values well below 10^-40 (p < 10^-40) [ARTIFACT:art_PAVwq5tc5rW6]. This confirms that smoothing over a 3-point window provides a statistically highly significant advantage in suppressing observation noise over naive persistence [ARTIFACT:art_PAVwq5tc5rW6].\n\n# Discussion\n\nOur empirical findings confirm the central hypothesis: smoothing short, noisy time series with a 3-point moving average significantly outperforms naive last-value forecasting. When observation noise (sigma = 1.0) corrupts a sequence, naive persistence projects the noise directly into the one-step-ahead forecast, thereby amplifying variance. In contrast, the sliding window average dampens high-frequency noise variance by a factor proportional to the window size, leading to superior predictive accuracy [ARTIFACT:art_-9wvKstb0T26].\n\n## Limitations\n\nWhile our study provides rigorous statistical validation under controlled synthetic conditions, several limitations should be noted:\n\n1. **Fixed Window Size**: We evaluated a fixed window size of K = 3. While optimal for short sequences, varying noise levels or trend velocities may require adaptive or larger window sizes [ARTIFACT:art_k4m-oBvAqLyv].\n2. **Synthetic Data Assumption**: Our evaluation focused on linear trends with additive Gaussian noise. Real-world series often exhibit non-stationary behaviors, structural breaks, and non-Gaussian error distributions [1].\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we evaluated the performance trade-offs between a 3-point moving average forecasting model and a naive last-value persistence baseline on short, noisy synthetic time series. Our empirical results demonstrate that moving average smoothing reduces Mean Squared Error from 1.9847 to 1.3558 (p < 10^-40), proving the efficacy of local smoothing under Gaussian noise. Future work will investigate adaptive window selection and non-stationary time series domains.\n\n# References\n\n[1] G. E. Box, G. M. Jenkins, G. C. Reinsel, and G. M.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (novelty) Comparing a 3-point moving average to a naive persistence baseline is a textbook exercise in elementary signal processing and time series analysis. The variance reduction property of moving averages is analytically derivable and well-documented in classical literature.
  Action: Refocus the paper around adaptive window sizing or dynamic noise regimes, moving beyond the trivial static K=3 comparison.
- [MAJOR] (scope) The evaluation is restricted to a single fixed window size (K=3) and a single noise level (sigma=1.0) in the primary results table, despite the synthetic data generator supporting broader parameter sweeps.
  Action: Include a comprehensive phase diagram or sensitivity analysis matrix showing performance across varying K in {1, 3, 5, 10} and sigma in {0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0}.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The comparison lacks broader classical baselines such as Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) with optimized smoothing parameter alpha, which is the standard baseline in M-competitions.
  Action: Add Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) as an additional baseline alongside naive persistence and moving average.

Your previous response had issues that need fixing:

DEPENDENCY ERRORS (depends_on can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>):
  - Strategy 1: Artifact 'evaluation_iter2_dir2' (evaluation): dependency 'art_PAVwq5tc5rW6' has type 'evaluation' which is not allowed (allowed: {'dataset', 'experiment'})
  - Strategy 1: Artifact 'evaluation_iter2_dir2' (evaluation): missing required dependency. Must have at least one dependency of type: {'experiment'}

</verification_results>

<task>
Fix ALL issues above and regenerate your strategies:

1. Fix dependency errors:
   - depends_on is a list of {id, label} objects — every entry MUST have a non-empty short label
   - id can ONLY reference IDs from <existing_artifacts>
   - You CANNOT reference artifacts you are proposing in this strategy as dependencies (they all run in parallel)
   - Follow the dependency type rules (e.g., experiments require datasets)
   - If no suitable existing artifacts exist, use depends_on: []

Output the corrected JSON with the fixed strategies.
</task>
```
